EduNet â€“ Donation Platform for NGOs

EduNet is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of collecting and distributing donations to registered NGOs. The platform serves as a secure bridge between donors and non-profit organizations, ensuring transparency, fairness, and efficiency in the allocation of funds.

With EduNet, NGOs can register and manage their organizational profiles, while donors can easily contribute any amount of their choice. Once donations reach a set threshold (e.g., R20,000), EduNet automatically distributes the funds evenly among a randomly selected group of NGOs, helping to ensure equal opportunities and reduce bias.

The platform also incorporates a small service fee (e.g., 10%) to maintain operations and further develop features that benefit both NGOs and donors.

Key Features:

NGO Registration: Verified NGOs can register and maintain their profiles.

Donation Portal: Donors can contribute seamlessly with multiple payment options.

Automated Fund Distribution: Donations are pooled and fairly allocated across NGOs once thresholds are reached.

Transparency: Donors can track how funds are split and which NGOs benefited.

Secure Transactions: End-to-end encryption and secure payment gateways.

EduNet empowers NGOs by making funding more accessible while giving donors confidence that their contributions are managed responsibly and equitably.
